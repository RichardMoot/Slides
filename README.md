# Slides and Presentations
Slides for some of selected presentations, some old, some new. As is usual, these slides serve as support for talks I have given on different occasions, and they have not really been designed as stand-alone reading material. However, feel free to contact me with any remarks or questions about these slides.

* [Supergrover or reconciling vectors and proofs](WoLLIC2019.pdf), invited talk at the [WoLLIC 2019](https://wollic2019.sites.uu.nl) workshop on compositionality in formal and distributional semantics. Discusses deep learning, supertagging and vector representations for words.

* [First-order linear logic for natural language analysis](Stockholm2017), invited talk at the workshop on [Logic and Algorithms for Computational Linguistics](http://staff.math.su.se/rloukanova/LACompLing17.html) in Stockholm, 2017, about first-order linear logic as a general framework for language modelling and parsing.

* [Wide coverage semantics](WCS_Dusseldorf.pdf), talk in Düsseldorf about wide-coverage semantics using type-logical grammars, one of the first presentations of [Grail Light](https://richardmoot.github.io/GrailLight) with the deep learning component ([DeepGrail](https://richardmoot.github.io/DeepGrail)); also has some discussion about the difference between type-logical grammars and combinatory categorial grammars.

* [Towards a computational analysis of debates](NASSLLI2016.pdf), invited talk at the NASSLLI 2016 workshop on compositionality in semantics, talking about theories of meaning, wide-coverage semantics and the computational analysis of debates in the context of the [AREN](http://www.lirmm.fr/aren/) project.

* [Logic and topology](LogicAndTopology), and older talk about logic and topology in the context of the [Itipy](https://richardmoot.github.io/Itipy/) project, talking notably the logic S4u (the modal logic S4 with a universal modality, denoting true in all worlds).

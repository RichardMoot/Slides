# Slides and Presentations
Slides for some of selected presentations, some old, some new. As is usual, these slides serve as support for talks I have given on different occasions, and they have not really been designed as stand-alone reading material. However, feel free to contact me with any remarks or questions about these slides.


* [Wide coverage semantics](WCS_Dusseldorf.pdf), talk in DÃ¼sseldorf about wide-coverage semantics using type-logical grammars, one of the first presentations of [Grail Light](https://richardmoot.github.io/GrailLight) with the deep learning component ([DeepGrail](https://richardmoot.github.io/DeepGrail)); also has some discussion about the difference between type-logical grammars and combinatory categorial grammars

* [Logic and topology](LogicAndTopology), and older talk about logic and topology, notably the logic S4u (S4 with a universal modality, denoting true in all worlds)
